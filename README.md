I've build an application that allows users to search for Spotify artists. It’s an audio player, very similar with Spotify.

For setup I've used my own boilerplate package, I didn't used codepen.io, because I created a structured app using different components,
functional components and class based components.

To fetch that data from the server, I've used jQuery as my HTTP library.

I’ve build this app using only React. By building this, I’ve covered numerous React core topics,
including JSX, components, state.

I’ve used ES6 features like class, arrow functions, import and export statements, template strings.
